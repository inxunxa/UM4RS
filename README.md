# UM4RS
**User Modeling framework For Recommender Systems**      
UM4RS (pronounced UMARS) is an open-source C# .NetFramework-based modeling framework.   
This is library will store and manage the _User_ and _Context_ and _Activity_ information needed for a Context-Aware Recommender Systems (CARS). The model also support the information about the _Items_ the CARS will recommend.

------------------------------

## Features
- C# using EntityFramework Code First as ORM strategy
- Well structured Object-Oriented architecture
- Scientific investigation project
- Developer-friendly, by developers, to developers "_developers, developers, developers...._"

<br><br><br>
## Usage
```csharp
    // specify the connection string
    UM4RS.ModelORM.ConString = @"Data Source=.\SQLEXPRESS;Initial Catalog=UM4RS;Integrated Security=True";

    // create objects
    var user = new User();
    user.Contact = new Contact();
    user.Contact.FirstName = "John";
    user.Contact.LastName = "Doe";

    // or using object initializers
    var address = new Address()
    {
       Street = "One Microsoft Way",
       City = "Redmond",
       State = "Washington"
    };
    user.Contact.Address = address;

    // saving  the root object will save children (if changed)
    user.Save();

    // or you could save each object
    //user.Contact.Address.Save();
    //user.Contact.Save();
    //user.Save();
```


<br>
### Creating and Saving objects
You could create new objects in two ways. Creating the object and ask it to save himself (as shown above).

Or creating the object and saving it through a specfic DataBase connection:
```csharp
using (var db = new ModelORM())
{
    db.Users.Add(new User()
    {
        Contact = new Contact()
        {
            FirstName = "Jonh"
            // ...
        }
    });
    db.SaveChanges();
}
    
```

**What method to use ?**   
The first method is preferred to use in the framework as this same method of saving object will be implemented for different languages.

The second method will work only for C# developers. The choise is yours.    


<br>
### Retrieving data
Data retrieval can be done through the static method of the model classes. The following example shows:
1. how to get the list of all records (users in this case).
2. how to get a record by its id
3. how to get the records that match a given query.

```csharp
    var userList = User.GetAll(); 
    var theUser = User.Get(42);   
    var singleUser = User.FindAll(x => x.Contact.FirstName == "John");
```

## Installation and Configuration 
- Include **UM4RS**.dll in your project References

- Include a Reference to **EntityFramework**:   
    Manual: Reference the provided EntityFramework.dll   
     Nuget: Install-Package EntityFramework

- Include a Reference for **EntityFramework database provider**:
    - For SQL Server: EntityFramework.SqlServer
        Manual: Reference the provided EntityFramework.SqlServer.dll
         Nuget: Install-Package EntityFramework.SqlServer

    - For MySql database server:
         Nuget: Install-Package MySql.Data.Entity.EF6
         More info: [Mysql page](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/connector-net/en/connector-net-entityframework60.html)


<br>
### Connection String
- Configure the _ConnectionString_ to allow the model comunicate with a database.
Ensure the connection string is configure before any dabase involved action.

```csharp
    UM4RS.ModelORM.ConString = "my connection string here";   
    // example: @"Data Source=.\SQLEXPRESS;Initial Catalog=UM4RS;Integrated Security=True";
```

<br><br>
## Entity IDs 
All _Entity_ subclasses will have an ID, that represent the KEY column of the Database.
By Detault the ID is **Autoincrementable** and has a private **set**.
If you want to asign your own values to the ID, annotate the property in the desired class with:
```csharp
    [DatabaseGenerated(DatabaseGeneratedOption.None)]
```

**NOTES:**
When the ID is non autogenerated, is you retrieve objects with Class.Get(id), the retrieved instance has no tracking enabled, therefore when you modify it, and want to save it again it will try to create a new record with a duplicated ID and an EntityFramework exception will raise, in other words (language) that is:
```csharp
    var usr = new User()
    {
        Id = 1
    };
    usr.Save(); 
    // until here no problem, you assigned your own ID to the Entity

    usr.Demographic = new Demographic()
    {
        Gender = Gender.Female
    };
    usr.Save(); // <- Exception raise here
    // EF tried to create a new (User) record with the same Id
```

If you need (really want) to asign the ID values, we recommend working with creating/updating entities this way:
```csharp
    using (var db = new ModelORM())
    {
        var usr = new User() {Id = 1};
        db.Users.Add(usr);
        db.SaveChanges();

        usr.Demographic = new Demographic()
        {
            Gender = Gender.Male
        };
        db.SaveChanges();
    }
```
